# Pokedex
This code is a basic implementation of a Pokédex in Python using a PokemonData class to fetch information from a Pandas DataFrame. It allows users to search for Pokémon information such as name, Pokédex number, types, height, weight, and more, and display the corresponding image of the searched Pokémon.
